            <strong>Minishogi</strong> rules apply.<br><br>
            <strong>Grid: </strong><br> Game is played on a 5x5 board. There can be also pieces on the players' "hands".<br>
            Each player begins with a set of 6 pieces: King, Gold General, Silver General, Bishop, Rook and Pawn.<br>
            <strong>The board starting position:</strong>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 12px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lj7VLOi.png" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"></img></p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Player 0(<strong style="color:#ff1d5c">red</strong>/black) has pieces at the bottom and Player 1(<strong style="color:#22a1e4">blue</strong>/white) has pieces at the top.</li>
                <li>For the <strong style="color:#ff1d5c">Player 0</strong>, at the bottom from left are: King, Gold General, Silver General, Bishop, Rook. Pawn is at the front of the King.</li>
                <li>For the <strong style="color:#f0f0b0">Player 1</strong>, at the top from left are: Rook, Bishop, Silver General, Gold General, King. Pawn is at the front of the King.</li>
                <li>Black always goes first and white goes next. Player rolls die on each turn.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>Movement: </strong><br>
            Each piece has its own movement:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>King (王,K)</strong> moves one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
                <li><strong>Rook (飛,R)</strong> moves as many squares as desired horizontally or vertically.</li>
                <li><strong>Bishop (角,B)</strong> moves as many squares as desired diagonally.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold General (金,G)</strong> moves one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Except it cannot move backward diagonally.</li>
                <li><strong>Silver General (銀,S)</strong> moves one square diagonally or one square forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Pawn (歩,P)</strong> moves one square forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoted Silver General (<span style="color: #ff0000;">金</span>,+S), Promoted Pawn (と,+P)</strong> move like Gold General.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoted Rook (Dragon,龍王,+R)</strong> has movements of Rook and King.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoted Bishop (Horse,龍馬,+B)</strong> has movements of Bishop and King.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>Promotion: </strong><br>
            Whenever a piece <strong>reaches, moves on, or moves out of</strong> its furthest rank (row) (rank 5 for black player and rank 1 for white player), it can be promoted. Promotions are optional except for pawn, it has to be promoted when it reaches the furthest rank.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rook</strong> promotes into <strong>Promoted Rook (Dragon)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Bishop</strong> promotes into <strong>Promoted Bishop (Horse)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Silver General</strong> promotes into <strong>Promoted Silver General</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Pawn</strong> promotes into <strong>Promoted Pawn</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>King, Gold General</strong> cannot be promoted.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>Captures: </strong><br>
            When a player's piece goes into a square occupied by the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and goes <strong>unpromoted</strong> into the player's hand. In the subsequent turns, the player may choose to drop the piece onto the board under his control.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Drops: </strong><br>
            On any turn, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may select a piece in his hand and place it <strong>unpromoted</strong> on any empty square on the board, under his control. There are some restrictions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pawn</strong> cannot be placed onto its furthest rank (row).</li>
                <li><strong>Pawn</strong> cannot be placed onto file (column) that already contains player's unpromoted pawn.</li>
                <li><strong>Pawn</strong> cannot deliver checkmate in the same turn. But it can do so in the subsequent turns.</li>
                <li>Dropped piece on the furthest rank (row) doesn't get promoted in the same turn. But it may be promoted in the subsequent turns.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>Check, checkmate and stalemate:</strong><br>
            If player's king is under attack of opponent's piece and would be captured in the next turn, it is in <strong>check</strong>. The player must remove the check. If he cannot, then his king is <strong>checkmated</strong> and the player loses game.<br>
            If player's king isn't in <strong>check</strong>, but also the player doesn't have any legal move, then it is <strong>stalemate</strong>, and the player also loses game.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Dice rolling and movement: </strong><br>
            In <strong>Dice Shogi</strong>, at the start of a turn, the player rolls a die. The value of the die is the index of file (column) the piece must go to or be dropped to. The index starts from 5 from left to 1 to right, like the board notation.<br><br>
            <strong>Player has rolled <const>5</const>. He can move the Pawn in column <const>5</const>, or move the Bishop to column <const>5</const>.</strong><br>

            <strong>Player has rolled <const>2</const>. He can move the Silver General to column <const>2</const>.</strong><br>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 12px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8GQI5bb.png" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"></img></p><br>
            <strong>NOTES:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player rolls <const>6</const>, then he can move to or drop to on any file (column).</li>
                <li>If a player doesn't have legal move with the rolled file (column), then he can move to or drop to on any other file (column).</li>
            </ul>
